# Brief
 Use the deep learning recursive neural network keras RNN-LSTM Seq2Seq Many to Many model to predict some untrained points on a circle.

# Environment
Google Colab CPU/GPU/TPU<br>
keras 2.2.5 LSTM<br>
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS<br>
Python 3.6.8<br>
Numpy 1.17.3<br>
Pandas 0.25.2<br>
sklearn 0.21.3

By increasing the number of epochs and neurons, a satisfactory result is obtained in accuracy as shown above. This shows how important the adjustment of hyperparameters, including the selection of cost functions and activation functions, is in terms of accuracy.
